                It is possible (but unlikely) that someone malicious
                could break into our systems and access your data. It
                is also possible that we could make a mistake in how we
                release the data, allowing someone else to figure out
                your real identity in the data set. We will do our best
                to prevent these outcomes, but these are always risks
                with digital information. No security and privacy
                protections are perfect.

                Batea is designed from the ground up to minimize the
                amount of data that it collects and to protect what
                data it does collect from simple disclosure. However,
                it is impossible to predict how even a portion of your
                browsing patterns might be used against you in the
                future, so it is difficult to assess how great of a
                risk this is.

                However, many other organizations collect browsing
                patterns, without making any comittment to
                protecting your privacy. DocGraph (the researching
                organization behind Batea) is likely among the least
                risky organizations that have an interest in your
                browsing patterns.
